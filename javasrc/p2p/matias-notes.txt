dynamic trust model

each ss needs to have a level of trust assigned for each known ss
    - different trust depending on different current mode of operation?


getting to know other service spaces... how?
    - signing public keys? (like PGP)
        - are the keys sent all the time, or just once?
        - probably once to each other service space... --> meeting protocol

    - "meeting protocol"....
        - option 1:
            1. A receives request from B, which it does not know
            2. A sends B an "I don't know you" response
                - this requires proper error reporting for all types of calls
            3. either:
                A sends B a list of service spaces that it *does* know
                and trust enough that they can "vouch" for B. B selectes
                a service space that trusts it to vouch for it.
             or
                B asks A one by one if it knows and trusts service spaces that B
                knows will vouch for it.
            4. B gets a signature on its public key by the service C, which A trusts
               and which trusts B, and sends it to A
            5. A verifies the signature and adds B to its list of known service spaces.
            6. A now re-processes B's original request.
